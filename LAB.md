# Assignment Overview: Lab 14

## Create an Order Form and a Shopping Cart

The focus group results have been collected and the BusMall catalog is ready to be released! The results were so positive that the marketing team would also like to make these products available for online purchase. Your new task is to create an order form page and a shopping cart page.

The marketing team wants the site to go live at the end of the day today, so they need the completed files by 5:00 p.m. today. To give you an idea of what they are looking for, the team has added some `TODO` tasks throughout the JavaScript files. They do not have any preferences for styling, so use your best judgment when filling in the `style.css` file. However, they refuse to budge on the structure of the website and have asked that you *DO NOT* modify the HTML files in any way.

This is a pair programming lab. One person from the pair will fork the lab repo and add the other person as a collborator. Fill in the necessary code in the JavaScript and CSS files, but do not modify the HTML files in any way.

This assignment is due at 5:00 p.m. today.
